# WIP - Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters (Unity)

![Current state](Doc/demo.gif)

This project is an implementation of **Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters** originally developed by [Craig W. Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/).
It is based on the Unity adaptation by [Edirlei Soares de Lima](https://edirlei.com/aulas/game-ai-2020/GAME_AI_Lecture_07_Steering_Behaviours_2020.html), with additional modifications and improvements made by me.

## Overview

This repository provides a Unity-based implementation of fundamental steering behaviors used in autonomous agent movement and AI.
It aims to be a flexible and extensible framework for experimenting with and visualizing different movement behaviors.

## Current State

The following behaviors are currently implemented:

* **Seek**
* **Arrive**
* **Wander**
* **Obstacle Avoidance**

## To-Do

* [ ] Path Following
* [ ] Wall Following
* [ ] Collision Avoidance
* [ ] Separation, Cohesion, Alignment (Group Behaviors)
* [ ] Refactor monolithic code structure
* [ ] Separate behaviors, agent perception, and movement logic
* [ ] Create a more user-friendly Unity Inspector interface
